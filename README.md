# wind-data-utils

## Introduction

### About this repository:
#### The main intention is to provide use cases with examples of common methodologies and situations where wind data is involved but to also present new developments and insights for the upcomming trends & needs in the general topic of wind data for the wind power market. So both students, developers and engeneers are welcome to comment and re-use code and ideas from what can be found in this repository.

### From the author:
#### Working in the wind undustry for more than 15 years I've been involved in many projects where data manipulation, analysis and improvements are performed. I've been working as scientific programmer mainly delivering added value from reanalysis, mesoscale models and measurements to engeneers.

### TOPICS
